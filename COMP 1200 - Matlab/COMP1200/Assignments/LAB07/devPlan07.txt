ASSIGNMENT:  Lab07
DATE:        October 27th, 2011

PROBLEM SOLVING IN ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE 
Always use a systematic problem-solving strategy.

1. STATE THE PROBLEM:
---Describe the problem to be solved for the assignment.
The program will need to build vectors to store from the velocites and distances that are 
given by the "hubbleData.txt" file. It will also compute the sums that are needed. 
It will find the slope and y-intercept and it will also print the velocity and 
distance vectors. By using all of this information it will plot a "velocity 
vs. distance" graph. 




2. DESCRIBE THE INPUT AND OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
---List and describe the following as needed to solve the problem, as needed.
---Include units where needed.

   CONSTANTS (known values that don't change):
 N/A


   INPUT (values needed to find the output):
Hubble's data from hubbleData.txt
velocity and distance

			

   OUTPUT (unknowns)
Print the velocities and distances in a table
Print Linear Equation
Plot scatter plot and line graph
 


   Relevant formulas: 
	(for complicated equations, it may be helpful to divide it into parts)
slope_1 = (r.*velocity_sum_distance - velocity_sum.*distance_sum);
slope_2 = (r.*velocity_sum_sq - (velocity_sum.^2));
slope = slope_1/slope_2;
intercept_1 = ((distance_sum.*velocity_sum_sq)-(velocity_sum.*velocity_sum_distance));
intercept_2 = (r.*velocity_sum_sq - (velocity_sum.^2));
intercept = intercept_1/intercept_2;
 
y=mx+b



3. WORK HAND EXAMPLES
---Solve the problem with a few hand examples.
---Record the input values used and the results





4. DEVELOP AN ALGORITHM:
---Think about the steps used to solve the problem to solve the problem by 
   hand and list them here to create an algorithm. 
---The algorithm steps should be used as comments in your program as a guide.

*****INITIALIZE*****
initializes the summation of the distances, velocities, velocities squared, and velocities time distances' sum.


*****INPUT*****
-Read Hubble's data from hubbleData.txt
-Use a while loop for reading the data file.
-Use counting loops when summing data and printing table.


*****COMPUTATION*****
-Create the linear equation that estimates the relationship between the velocity and distance readings.
-accumulate into sums data
-compute SLOPE (m)
-compute INTERCEPT (b)
-Draw a scatter plot and the line graph for the data pairs


*****OUTPUT*****
-Print the slope and y-intercept in the form of a linear equation.
-Display the data in a scatter plot and line graph
-Print the velocities and distances in a two columns with a title and column headings




5. SOLVE THE PROBLEM:
---This step represents your writing a computer program to solve the problem. 
---NOTE: Do not type your program here. Submit it as a computer program file. 
---Use steps in your algorithm as comments in your program 
   to guide the development of you program.

6. TEST THE SOLUTION:
---Run your program using the values from #3 to check for correctness.
---If there is an error, correct your program code and run again.
