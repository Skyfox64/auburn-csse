PROBLEM SOLVING IN ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE 
Always use a systematic problem-solving strategy.

1. STATE THE PROBLEM:
The purpose of this assignment is to get the user to enter in data, turning it into an index.
The program will then compute the number of pairs, and the sums needed to compute the slope and y-intercept.
It will also place this data into a table and show the slope and y-intercept in the form of a linear equation. 
The user will be able to enter one of the velocities entered earlier and get the distance using the linear equation that is created in my program.
 







2. DESCRIBE THE INPUT AND OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
---List and describe the following as needed to solve the problem, as needed.
---Include units where needed.

   CONSTANTS (known values that don't change):
None.


   INPUT (values needed to find the output):
counter and accumulators 
while velocity not = 0
ask user to enter a velocity and distance 
add values to vectors
increment counter

			
   OUTPUT (unknowns):
print velocity and distance data in table
print LINEAR EQUATION: y = mx + b
print velocity and distance


   Relevant formulas (for complicated equations, it may be helpful to divide it into parts):
slope = ((vel_counter)*sum(vel.*dist)-sum(vel)*sum(dist))/((vel_counter)*sum(vel.*vel)-sum(vel)*sum(vel))
intercept = (sum(dist)*sum(vel.*vel)-sum(vel)*sum(vel.*dist))/((vel_counter)*sum(vel.*vel)-sum(vel)*sum(vel))
Regression Equation: y = mx + b
 







3. WORK HAND EXAMPLES
---Solve the problem with a few hand examples.
---Record the input values used and the results

Slope(m)=[n*(sum(x*y))-(sum(x))*(sum(y))]/[n*(sum(x^2))-(sum(x))^2]

Intercept(b)=[(sum(y))*(sum(x)^2)-(sum(x))*(sum(x*y))]/[n*(sum(x^2))-(sum(x)^2)]

My sample input
 NEBULA INPUT DATA
 VELOCITY  DISTANCE
  km/sec  106 parsecs
      7      2.000
      6      3.000
      5      4.000
      4      5.000
      x       y


Slope(m)=[4*(sum(x*y))-(sum(x))*(sum(y))]/[4*(sum(x^2))-(sum(x))^2]

                     =[(4*(72))-(22)*(14)]/[(4*(126))-(22)^2]
                                =[288-308]/[504-484]
                                     =-20/20

                     m = -1.00


Intercept(b)=[(sum(y))*(sum(x)^2)-(sum(x))*(sum(x*y))]/[4*(sum(x^2))-(sum(x)^2)]

                               =[(14)*(126)-(22)*(72)]/[(4*(126))-(22)^2)]
                                          =[1764-1584]/[504-484]
                                                  =180/20
                     b = +9.00


Regression Equation: y = mx + b

              distance = -1.00 * velocity + 9.00
