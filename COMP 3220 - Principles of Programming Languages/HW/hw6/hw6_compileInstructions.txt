Compile Instructions using windows command line
1. In the command shell window, change the current directory to the one containing the .java file you wish to compile.
	Ex: hw6Driver.java could be found in C:\Users\<Username>\Auburn\2014-2015 Fall\COMP 3220 - Principles of Programming Languages\HW\hw6\src
2. Once you know the file is in your current directory, type: javac <fileName>.java
	This will compile and create a class file.
3. Execute the class file.




Compile Instructions using IDE's
1. Open file in IDE using "open with..." or through the IDE. Add the .java to a new project file if need be.
2. Using, Auburn University favorite, jGrasp you can compile with ctrl+b and run with ctrl+r.
