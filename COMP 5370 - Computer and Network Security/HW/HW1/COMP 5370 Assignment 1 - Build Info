COMP 5370 Assignment 1 - Build Info

"Write TCP/IP client-server socket programs such that when client sends two numbers, server replies with their sum in programming language of your choice. (C, C++, Java)

Source code must be submitted with build info.

This is individual assignment. 

Date of Submission – 2nd September 2015"

I used Java for the socket programming assignment. I also used IntelliJ IDEA as my development tool.


Source files are in zip folder submitted on Canvas. This build information is in the same folder directory. I placed the entire IntelliJ project folder into the submission folder. TO get to the .class files, go to “~/NetworkSecurity_HW1/out/production/NetworkSecurity_HW1/“ . There are the .class files. 
Go to the src folder in /NetworkSecurity_HW1/src/ for .java files, then compile if wanted. Run the .class files instead of compiling.

Change directory from the project folder in terminal by using this command line:
cd ./out/production/NetworkSecurity_HW1/

1) To run, open up the terminal, compile SimpleServer.java, then run it. Make sure it is running before the client.
e.g “$ java SimpleServer”

2) Open up a secondary terminal, compile SimpleClient.java, then run it.
e.g “$ java SimpleClient 2 5”

Provided, I have a screenshot(s) of my terminal and testing.
