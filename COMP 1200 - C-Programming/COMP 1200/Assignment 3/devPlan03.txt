PROBLEM SOLVING IN ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE 
Always use a systematic problem-solving strategy.

1. STATE THE PROBLEM:
---Describe the problem to be solved for the assignment.

Find the Body Mass Index (BMI) for a given height(in inches) and weight(in pounds). 
Determine the BMI catagory.
Compute and display the target weight for a given BMI.
Compute the Idea Body Weight (IBW) for given height and gender.


2. DESCRIBE THE INPUT AND OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
---List and describe the following as needed to solve the problem, as needed.
---Include units where needed.

   CONSTANTS (known values that don't change):
 
none

   INPUT (values needed to find the output):
 
height in inches
weight in pounds
BMI
gender			

   OUTPUT (unknowns)

BMI
weight in pounds
IBW

   OTHER VARIABLES

height in meters
weight in kilograms

   Relevant formulas: 
	(for complicated equations, it may be helpful to divide it into parts)
 
BMI = mass in kg / (height in meters)^2
1 kg = 2.2046 pounds 
1 inch = 2,54 cm

IBW (men)   = 50.0 + 2.3 * (height - 60)
IBW (women) = 45.5 + 2.3 * (height - 60)


3. WORK HAND EXAMPLES
---Solve the problem with a few hand examples.
---Record the input values used and the results

ht(in) wt(lbs) BMI      BMI  wt(lbs)  F/M IBW
72     165     22.378   25   184.333  M   171.08
59     100     20.20    25   123.78   F    95.24
 

4. DEVELOP AN ALGORITHM:
---Think about the steps used to solve the problem to solve the problem by 
   hand and list them here to create an algorithm. 
---The algorithm steps should be used as comments in your program as a guide.

Prompt the user to enter a value for weight in pounds and height in inches.
---BMI---
Compute conversions.
Calculate 
Display BMI.

Display BMI classification
   if BMI < 25 normal
   else if BMI 25-30 overweight
   else obese
---Target BMI and weight---
Prompt the user to enter a value for BMI.
Compute weight.	
Compute conversions.
Display weight
---IBW---
Prompt user to enter the gender (1 or 2).
Compute IBW for given height and gender.
Display IBW


5. SOLVE THE PROBLEM:
---This step represents your writing a computer program to solve the problem. 
---NOTE: Do not type your program here. Submit it as a computer program file. 
---Use steps in your algorithm as comments in your program 
   to guide the development of you program.

6. TEST THE SOLUTION:
---Run your program using the values from #3 to check for correctness.
---If there is an error, correct your program code and run again.
