NAME: John Carroll                                        
ASSIGNMENT: Assignment05                       
DATE: March 7th, 2012       
                                                                                    
PROBLEM SOLVING IN ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE 
Always use a systematic problem-solving strategy.

1. STATE THE PROBLEM:
---Describe the problem to be solved for the assignment.

Open and read the file. Retrieve the mountains' heights from the 
data file. Convert the data into miles and then calculate the 
distance to the horizon for each mountain. Display the data in a 
table. Print the highest mountain on each planet at the end of the 
file.

2. DESCRIBE THE INPUT AND OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
---List and describe the following as needed to solve the problem, as needed.
---Include units where needed.

   CONSTANTS (known values that don't change):

filename
earth_diameter=7926 
mars_diameter=4217

   INPUT (values needed to find the output):

mountainHeights.txt data
	-Planet number(3 or 4)
	-Mountain height for earth(ft) and Mars(km) 
			

   OUTPUT (unknowns)

Distance to the horizon for all mountains
Highest mountain on Mars
Highest mountain on Earth


   OTHER VARIABLES

Height converted into miles


   Relevant formulas: 
	(for complicated equations, it may be helpful to divide it into parts)
EARTH
Conversion for the mountain: Height = mountainHeight/5280
horizonDistance (Earth) = (sqrt((2*(7926/2)*Height)+(Height^2)))

MARS
Conversion for the mountain: Height = mountainHeight/1.609344
horizonDistance (Mars) = (sqrt((2*(4217/2)*Height)+(Height^2)))

*Note: Height = convertedMountainHeight 


3. WORK HAND EXAMPLES
---Solve the problem with a few hand examples.
---Record the input values used and the results
___Example____
Datafile info:
2
4 27.0
3 29029.0

Output:
Distance from Mountain Peak and Horizon
Planet   Mountain    Horizon
Number    Height*   Distance*
------   --------   --------
  4        16.8      266.5
  3         5.5      208.8





4. DEVELOP AN ALGORITHM:
---Think about the steps used to solve the problem to solve the problem by 
   hand and list them here to create an algorithm. 
---The algorithm steps should be used as comments in your program as a guide.

include math.h
define CONSTANTS
---Open File/INPUT---
Use FILE * and name the file.
Use fscanf to read the "11", which is the count, the number of items to be scanned until the program stops.
----Distance to the Horizon----
Display Table Headers.
Initialize for loop for one loop of the data file.
Scan the two columns of the data file.
Create switching function between the two cases.
		Convert the height into Miles
		Calculate the distance to the horizon
		Place the max mountains as their own variables
Display the data in the table, right aligned
Display the units
----Highest mountains----
Display the highest mountain on Mars.
Display the highest mountain on Earth.





5. SOLVE THE PROBLEM:
---This step represents your writing a computer program to solve the problem. 
---NOTE: Do not type your program here. Submit it as a computer program file. 
---Use steps in your algorithm as comments in your program 
   to guide the development of you program.

6. TEST THE SOLUTION:
---Run your program using the values from #3 to check for correctness.
---If there is an error, correct your program code and run again.
