NAME: John Carroll                       
ASSIGNMENT: Assignment04  (a & b)                   
DATE: February 15th, 2012                  
                                                      
PROBLEM SOLVING IN ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE 
Always use a systematic problem-solving strategy.

1. STATE THE PROBLEM:
---Describe the problem to be solved for the assignment.

Find the BMI for a given height(in inches) and weight(in pounds.)
Determine the BMI catagory.
Compute and display the target weight for a given BMI.
Compute the Idea Body Weight (IBW) for given height and gender.
Prompt the user to enter the requested values until program is given good data.
Prompt the user for the number of people, then execute program according to that number.



2. DESCRIBE THE INPUT AND OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
---List and describe the following as needed to solve the problem, as needed.
---Include units where needed.

   CONSTANTS (known values that don't change):
 
none

   INPUT (values needed to find the output):
 
height in inches
weight in pounds
BMI
gender			

   OUTPUT (unknowns)

BMI
weight in pounds
IBW

   OTHER VARIABLES

height in meters
weight in kilograms

   Relevant formulas: 
	(for complicated equations, it may be helpful to divide it into parts)
 
BMI = mass in kg / (height in meters)^2
1 kg = 2.2046 pounds 
1 inch = 2,54 cm

IBW (men)   = 50.0 + 2.3 * (height - 60)
IBW (women) = 45.5 + 2.3 * (height - 60)


3. WORK HAND EXAMPLES
---Solve the problem with a few hand examples.
---Record the input values used and the results

#People  ht(in) wt(lbs) Actual-BMI   Target-BMI    Target-wt(lbs)  F/M     IBW
      2      60     145      28.32           25            128.01    F  100.31
             72     165      22.38           25            184.33    M  171.08


4. DEVELOP AN ALGORITHM:
---Think about the steps used to solve the problem to solve the problem by 
   hand and list them here to create an algorithm. 
---The algorithm steps should be used as comments in your program as a guide.

[Prompt user for the number of people
For each person enter and compute stats]-part B
---INPUT---
While not a good weight, prompt the user to enter a value for weight in pounds
While not a good height, prompt the user to enter a value for height in inches.
----BMI----
Compute conversions.
Calculate.
Display BMI.
Display BMI classification
     if BMI < 25 normal
     else if BMI 25-30 overweight
     else obese
----Target BMI and weight----
Until good BMI, prompt the user to enter a value for BMI.
Compute weight.
Compute conversions.
Display weight.
----IBW----
While not a good gender, prompt user to enter the gender (F/f or M/m).
Compute IBW for given height and gender.
Compute conversions


5. SOLVE THE PROBLEM:
---This step represents your writing a computer program to solve the problem. 
---NOTE: Do not type your program here. Submit it as a computer program file. 
---Use steps in your algorithm as comments in your program 
   to guide the development of you program.

6. TEST THE SOLUTION:
---Run your program using the values from #3 to check for correctness.
---If there is an error, correct your program code and run again.
